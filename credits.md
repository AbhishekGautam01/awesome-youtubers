The awesome-youtubers logo and the corresponding badges icons were made by [Jos√© De Freitas](https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/).

The badges were created without following any design structure, though the [awesome-youtubers logo](https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/awesome-youtubers/blob/master/media/logo.svg) is inspired by the [awesome logo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/media/logo.svg) and the [awesome-nodejs logo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/blob/master/media/logo.svg). (I took those two files and put them below my artboard. Then I created a vector icon of the icon shape and added the YouTube color. The two play icons were created following the play button of the [YouTube logo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z6Sl4j9zQ88oUKNy0G3PAMiVwy8DzQLh_ygyvBXv0zVNUZ_wQPN_n7EAR2By3dhoUpX7kTpaHjRPni1MHwKpaBJbpNqdEsHZsH4q). It's just a representation, I'm not using the YouTube logo itself).

This list style was heavily inspired by [awesome-discord-communities](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities), created by [mhxion](https://github.com/mhxion). This repository was my inspiration as I consider this list ([awesome-youtubers](https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/awesome-youtubers)) also looks good with the same table-style in the [readme.md file](https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/awesome-youtubers/blob/master/readme.md), as well as the useful [badges](https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/awesome-youtubers/blob/master/badges.md).
