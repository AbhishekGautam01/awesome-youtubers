		This list contains youtubers whose content is based in the tech field and teach about tech stuff. Please, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/awesome-youtubers/blob/master/badges.md">badges.md</a> to know what the badges mean. The order of the youtubers doesn't mean the quality: all of the youtubers below are awesome. Every youtuber is in a specific section/subsection, though it may involve other topics that are not the ones according to the section (but the section the youtuber is in is its main content). Note that this <strong>is not</strong> a promotional list of any kind.
